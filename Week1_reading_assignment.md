I chose the article "Trash in the City", which I found in the atlas *Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas*. The article discusses the waste management practices of New York City, briefly summarizing the history of landfilling in the city and then describing the evolution of the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, from landfill into an urban park. Accompanying the article is a map of New York City that shows the following: flows of trash (represented by arrows and differentiated by recycling and waste), recycling sites that process paper, and waste transfer stations. Furthermore, the map shows union headquarters, sites of strikes, and lawsuits related to waste management. 

I like the way that this article and map reveal justice issues inherent to waste, which is usually conceived of as a subject with strictly technical dimensions. In fact, waste management has implications for environmental integrity, human and ecosystem health, and worker livelihoods. By overlaying the map of waste flows in New York with markers denoting sites of waste worker strikes and lawsuits, the map demonstrates that certain areas are hot spots of waste management and waste struggles, such as Long Island City and other parts of Brooklyn. After looking at the map, I was left with questions about chronology and about data sources (which are not included). This map depicts aspects of New York's contemporary waste management, but I imagine that the arrows representing waste flows have changed significantly even just over the past decade, reflecting changes both in global waste trade and local waste management site availability. Furthermore, I was left curious about the quantity of the waste shipped between different processing sites, and greater differentiation among the actors involved in the flows (to name just a few: transfer stations, haulers, informal collectors, etc). In sum, this article and accompanying map makes me think about the ways a map can support and even make an argument (in this case, about the unjust geographies of waste management and the disporportionate risks borne by workers and certain communities). I also think that it leaves many gaps in information that I previously listed, that I would aim to fill in when working on my own project.
